# Image-Enhancement-using-Modified-Histogram-Equalization
Image enhancement techniques are very important to image processing, which are used to improve image quality or extract the fine details in degraded images. This paper focusing on Image Enhancement using Modified Histogram Equalization. This research will implement, histogram equalization and compared that with the modified histogram equalization. This gives a way to control the enhancement of the details improving the quality of the image. The modified histogram is generated by adding the original image histogram with uniform histogram for producing the better visual quality as well as better enhancement.
